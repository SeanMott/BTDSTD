Bytes The Dust keeps a standard for how we handle the directional vectors of the world.
We do this so it's consistant for all projects and we don't need to change the math.

positive X is left
negative X is right

positive Y is up
negative Y is down

positive Z is forward
negative Z is backwards

matrices are row, colume

we support converting or conventions to match other Render APIs we support
